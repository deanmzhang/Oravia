# Oravia
3D platformer game developed in Unity.

A dark energy has spread throughout Oravia and has corrupted every single bird...except you. 

You take it upon yourself to travel through Oravia in order to purify every last bird and save Oravia from the darkness! 

But beware! Your former friends are now corrupted and will try to attack you, and the Ruler of Oravia has unleashed a disastrous storm you must plow through. 

To stop the storm and purify everyone, you must battle head to head with the Ruler of Oravia. 

However, you are not strong enough right now, so you must collect feathers to gain enough strength before attempting to heal the Ruler. 

Good luck!
